# WordCount

This project, aims to develop and study the performance of an algorithm capable of measuring the frequency of appearance of words in a given text. The development, supported by a development methodology (analysis, design, implementation and testing), it includes the design of different counting modes with the application of data structures to achieve the intended purpose.

## Interface

The interface is quite simple, it includes four different options to choose from:
* Select input file
* Calculate the frequency of appearance of words
* Visualize results
* Exit

## Data structures

The project requirement, was to study and develope four different data structures to acomplish the given task. We choose the following ones to compare to each other.
